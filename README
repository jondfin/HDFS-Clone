Important:
	- Name Node needs to be up prior to starting data nodes and the client
	- Upon starting up any datanodes, it will take a while before the client will
	receive correct responses. This is because the name node needs to update its data
	when it receives a heartbeat. After a heartbeat is received, HDFS should operate normally.
	- Configurables:
		- In nn_config.txt:
			- Blocksize - measured in bytes
			- Heartbeat timeout - measured in milliseconds. How long NN should wait before considering DN dead.
			- Name node data - name;ip;port
		- In dn_config.txt:
			- Replication factor
			- Heartbeat interval - measured in milliseconds. How long DNs should wait before sending out hearbeats.
			- Data node data - name/id;ip;port
	- If the filesystem is behaving incorrectly (e.g list does not display any files), wait a few seconds before trying again
		This is similar to the issue mentioned earlier where the Name Node needs a little time to process and update its metadata
Compilation and running instructions:
	To compile:
		> make
	To run:
		**Name node needs to be up first**
		**Name node is ready when you see "{nn.name} is ready"**
		**Datanode and client should work in any order**
		> make nn
		> make dn
		> make client
	To clear up binaries, Name Node metadata, and Data Node chunkfiles:
		> make clean
		
Working configuration using the ip's already in the config files:
	run NameNode on top.cs.rutgers.edu:6000
	run DataNode on kill.cs.rutgers.edu:5555
	run DataNode on cp.cs.rutgers.edu:6772
	run Client on any iLab machine
