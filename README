Important:
	- Name Node needs to be up prior to starting data nodes and the client
	- Upon starting up any datanodes, it will take a while before the client will
	receive correct responses. This is because the name node needs to update its data
	when it receives a heartbeat. After a heartbeat is received, HDFS should operate normally.
	- Configurables:
		- In nn_config.txt:
			- Blocksize - measured in bytes
			- Heartbeat timeout - measured in milliseconds. How long NN should wait before considering DN dead.
			- Name node data - name;ip;port
		- In dn_config.txt:
			- Replication factor
			- Heartbeat interval - measured in milliseconds. How long DNs should wait before sending out hearbeats.
			- Data node data - name/id;ip;port
			
Compilation and running instructions:
	To compile:
		- run the makefile using "make"
	To run:
		- java NameNode
			**Name node needs to be up first**
			**Datanode and client should work in any order**
		- java DataNode
		- java Client
	To clear up binaries:
		- run "make clean"
